# Identifying-Fraudulent-Activities
Predicting Fraud in Electronic Commerce:  Fraud  Detection Techniques in E-Commerce

## Goal
E-commerce websites often transact huge amounts of money. Whenever a huge
amount of money is moved, there is a high risk of users performing fraudulent activities, e.g. using stolen credit cards, doing money laundry, etc. 

Machine Learning really excels at identifying fraudulent activities. Any website where you put your credit card information has a risk team in charge of avoiding frauds and they often use machine learning. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts the probability that the first transaction of a new user is fraudulent.
